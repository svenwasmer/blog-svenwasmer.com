Solution architecture is a framework that bridges the gap between business problems and technology solutions. It ensures that every part of a system - from user experience to data storage - works together seamlessly.

The role of a solution architect is to define the structure, components, and interactions of a system to ensure it meets business and tech needs.

This includes choosing appropriate patterns (design and structural), defining service boundaries, and considering cross-functional architecture aspects like security, scalability, and performance.

In summary:
- Solution architecture creates a map from business problem to software design.
- It enables consistency, scalability, and alignment across systems.
