Retypset is a static blog theme based on the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework. This guide introduces how to modify theme configuration and create new posts, helping you quickly set up your personal blog.

## Theme Configuration

Customize your blog by creating a theme. The theme determines the overall layout and design of your blog. You can edit the colors, fonts, and other variables to match your personal preferences.

## Creating a Post

Posts are created using Markdown files with frontmatter. Each post should begin with frontmatter like this:
